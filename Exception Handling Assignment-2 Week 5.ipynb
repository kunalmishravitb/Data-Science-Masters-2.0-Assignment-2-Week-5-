    "Best practices for exception handling in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Be specific in exception handling: Catch and handle specific exceptions rather than using a generic 'except' block. This allows for targeted error handling and avoids unintentionally hiding other exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Use 'try-except-else' and 'finally' appropriately: Utilize the 'else' block to specify code that should run only if no exceptions occur in the 'try' block. Use the 'finally' block to specify code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, such as resource cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Handle exceptions at an appropriate level: Catch exceptions at the appropriate level of your code to handle them effectively. Avoid catching exceptions too early or letting them propagate too far up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Provide meaningful error messages: Include informative and descriptive error messages in exception handling code to help with debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Use exception chaining: When catching an exception, consider raising a new exception while preserving the original exception's information. This helps maintain a clear trace of the exception's origin and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Log exceptions: Consider logging exceptions instead of just printing error messages. Logging provides a more structured and persistent way to record exceptions and aids in debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Avoid suppressing exceptions: Avoid catching exceptions without taking any action or ignoring them completely. If you catch an exception, make sure to handle it appropriately or re-raise it if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) Keep exception handling code minimal: Try to keep exception handling code concise and focused on the specific error handling tasks. Avoid overly complex exception handling logic that might make the code harder to understand and maintain."
